# TUM Campus Straubing iGEM Team

## Who We Are


The iGEM Straubing team represents the **student-led** synthetic biology team from TUM Campus Straubing. As part of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, we are a dynamic and multidisciplinary group of undergraduate, graduate, (and advisory PhD) students united by our passion for synthetic biology, sustainable innovation, and real-world impact.

Our team combines diverse expertise from chemical biotechnology, bioprocessing, biogenic energy utilization, and business exertise‚Äîreflecting the unique interdisciplinary and international character of our campus. This diversity is our strength, enabling us to approach complex scientific challenges from multiple perspectives and develop holistic, innovative solutions.

### TUM Straubing Campus

## The iGEM Competition

## Our Achievements at iGEM

### iGEM 2024: Bluebear Bio Project

In our inaugural year competing as the very first iGEM team from TUM Campus Straubing, we achieved remarkable success with our [**Bluebear Bio: Cell-Free for All**](https://2024.igem.wiki/tum-straubing/) project.

Our 2024 project focused on developing desiccated cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) systems to make synthetic biology tools more accessible worldwide. By harnessing tardigrade proteins' resilience and developing cost-effective energy mixes, we created a solution that eliminates cold chain requirements and significantly reduces expenses. This innovation opens new opportunities for labs in resource-limited areas, advancing democratization of biotechnology.:
