# TUM Campus Straubing iGEM Team

## Who We Are


The iGEM Straubing team represents the **student-led** synthetic biology team from TUM Campus Straubing. As part of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, we are a dynamic and multidisciplinary group of undergraduate, graduate, (and advisory PhD) students united by our passion for synthetic biology, sustainable innovation, and real-world impact.

Our team combines diverse expertise from chemical biotechnology, bioprocessing, biogenic energy utilization, and business exertise—reflecting the unique interdisciplinary and international character of our campus. This diversity is our strength, enabling us to approach complex scientific challenges from multiple perspectives and develop holistic, innovative solutions.

### Technical University of Munich Campus Straubing

<div class="grid" markdown>

The Technical University of Munich (TUM) Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability is an Integrative Research Institute of the Technical University of Munich, uniquely positioned at the intersection of natural sciences, biotechnology, engineering, and economics. Located in Straubing—the region of renewable resources—our campus is at the heart of developing and scaling biotechnological processes.

Our campus offers interdisciplinary study programs including:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- Bioeconomy (B.Sc. & M.Sc.)

- Chemical Biotechnology (B.Sc. & M.Sc.)

- Biomass Technology (M.Sc.)

    Sustainable Energy and Processes (M.Sc.)

- Sustainable Management and Technology

    (B.Sc. & M.Sc.)

This multidisciplinary environment provides our team with access to cutting-edge facilities, diverse expertise, and a community committed to developing sustainable technologies that address pressing global issues.

## The iGEM Competition
The iGEM Competition is an annual, worldwide synthetic biology event aimed at undergraduate university students, as well as high school and graduate students. Multidisciplinary teams work together to design, build, test, and measure a system of their own design using interchangeable biological parts and standard molecular biology techniques. You can find more information in the official iGEM documentation:

## Our Achievements at iGEM

### iGEM 2024: Bluebear Bio Project

<div class="grid" markdown>

In our inaugural year competing as the very first iGEM team from TUM Campus Straubing, we achieved remarkable success with our [**Bluebear Bio: Cell-Free for All**](https://2024.igem.wiki/tum-straubing/) project. <br><br>
Our 2024 project focused on developing desiccated cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) systems to make synthetic biology tools more accessible worldwide. By harnessing tardigrade proteins' resilience and developing cost-effective energy mixes, we created a solution that eliminates cold chain requirements and significantly reduces expenses. This innovation opens new opportunities for labs in resource-limited areas, advancing democratization of biotechnology.
